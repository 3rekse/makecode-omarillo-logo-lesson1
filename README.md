# Turtle Logo - Lesson #1

## Turtle Logo - Lesson #1 @unplugged
**Welcome to coding with Turtle Logo.**

In this lesson you will create your first Turtle Logo program. You will get a **Turtle** showing up in your game console and have it say, "Hello, World!".
![Hello, World!](https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/makecode-arcade-turtle-logo-lesson1/raw/main/assets/hello_world_screenshot.png)

## Step 1
All our programs begin with an ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block. This block runs all the commands that are inside it as soon as the program begins. It has been provided for you below. If you accidentally delete the block, you can find it under the *"Loops"* menu.
```blocks
/**
 * This is the "on start" block
 */
```

## Step 2
** Follow Along**

Next you will need to create your **Turtle**. To do this you use the ‚á¢``show turtle``‚á† block and place it inside the ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block. This creates the **Turtle** and places it in the middle of the screen.
```blocks
turtle.showTurtle()
```

## Step 3
** Follow Along**

Now that we have a **Turtle**, you can ask it to say something. Drag out the ‚á¢``turtle says "Hello, World!" ‚äï``‚á† block and place it inside the ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block but after the ‚á¢``show turtle``‚á† block.
```blocks
turtle.showTurtle()
turtle.say("Hello, World!")
```
## Step 4
**Success!**

Notice in the game console to the left, your **Turtle** said "Hello, World!" for 5 second and then the words vanish. If you want to run your program again, click the "üîÅ" button on the game console. You can also click the "‚äï" and change the milliseconds to a larger number, to make it stay longer.
```blocks
turtle.showTurtle()
turtle.say("Hello, World!", 60000)
```

## Step 4
**Your Turn**

Get the **Turtle** to say your name!

## Step 5
**Done**

You have successfully completed your first lesson in Turtle Logo.
